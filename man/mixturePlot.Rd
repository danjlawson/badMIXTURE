\description{
This function takes a mixture solution as returned by \code{\link{compareMixtureToData}}) or \code{\link{compareMixtureToDataDirect}}) and plots it in a variety of ways.

Focus your attention on only the first two arguments: \code{adc} which is the processed mixture solution) and \code{show} which is how you choose the plots to display. The remaining arguments affect only the presentation of the plot.

It is essential to understand that there are two key structures being explored simultaneously in these plots. The first is the P-dimensional clustering of the data, which defines the similarities; each of the N data points has a similarity to these P clusters. A representation in this space is called a palette. The second is the K-dimensional set of admixture weights. Each of the K "ancestral" or latent variables also has a P dimensional palette. Further, each of the N data points has a K dimensional "admixture" breakdown, seen as a mixture of the K ancestral palettes.

The variety of plots available each explore different aspects of the fit of the mixture solution to the data.  We assume that the individuals are ordered by cluster and plot clusters as separated. These must match the palette in order.

A variety of plot types for "show" are available:
\itemize{
  \item Admixture : the Admixture profile, shown via the classic barplot. 
  \item Cluster : The assignment of individuals into the P clusters.
  \item Raw : The palettes, as observed in the data.
  \item Pred : The predicted palettes.
  \item Ancestral : The palettes of the ancestral populations.... See ancestralshow.
  \item Residual : The matrix of residuals. See resid.cols.
  \item Same : The part of the palette that was predicted and is present.
  \item Omni : A visualisation of the raw palette and its fit to the data. The palette is split into three parts: a) the predicted palette that is present in the data, shown immediately above the x-axis up to the black line. b) the additional palette that is present in the data but missing in the prediction, shown above the black line up to 1. c) the predicted palette that is not present in the data; this is shown beneath the x axis. Therefore everything shown above the x-axis represents the data, and everything below the black line represents the prediction.
}

There are also some other plots which are more experimental:
\itemize{
  \item Over : A comparison of the predicted palettes to the observed palette; the predicted palette is shown on top, with "over-prediction" shown in black. The "missing" part of the prediction is show at the bottom.
  \item Over2 : As "Over", but without "blacking out" the section of the prediction that was overpredicted.
  \item Under : 
  \item Under2 :
}

If you want to produce high quality plots, you may wish to control the plotting very carefully. It is still helpful to use these functions as they ensure that the x-axis aligns; however you might want to display your own annotation.

This is possible by calling with a single "show" argument, and setting  layout=FALSE. Then the plot will be drawn in the next available plotting area. You can disable all text overlay and add this yourself. See examples.

## Straightforward example:
data(arisim_remnants)
adm<-compareMixtureToData(arisim_remnants$mixture,
                          arisim_remnants$data,arisim_remnants$ids)
gpref=mixturePlot(adm)

## Example showing individual names clearly
data(arisimsmall)
adm<-compareMixtureToData(arisimsmall$mixture,arisimsmall$data,arisimsmall$ids)

gpref=mixturePlot(adm,
                  c("Admixture","Cluster","Raw","Residual"),
                  cex.names=0.5,residual.scale=0.2,height.cluster=.4)

## Complex example using layout and data subsetting
data(arisimsmall)
adm<-compareMixtureToData(arisimsmall$mixture,arisimsmall$data,arisimsmall$ids)
adm2=adm
adm2$mycols2[]="lightgrey"
adm2$mycols2[4:7]=c("darkred","orange","green","blue")

layout(matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,5,5,5),nrow=4,ncol=2),heights=c(1,0.4,1,1))
gpref=mixturePlot(adm2,
                  c("Admixture","Cluster","Raw","Residual"),
                  mainname=paste0("Admixture, Marginalization, Direct"),
                  mary.admixture=c(0,1),
                  cex.names=0,
            ancestralshow=c(1,2,4), 
            residual.max=NULL,
            residual.scale=0.2,
            residual.showscale=TRUE, 
            ancestral.mean=FALSE,
            xlim=c(24,56),
            uselayout=FALSE)
gpref=mixturePlot(adm2,"Ancestral",gpref=gpref,uselayout=FALSE)
